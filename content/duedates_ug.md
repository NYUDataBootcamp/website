# Data Bootcamp:  UG Due Dates

Due dates for Data Bootcamp @ NYU Stern, Fall 2016, Undergrad section.  Deliverables are due at the start of class on the dates listed.

**September 06** <br> First class.  Bring your computer, roll up your sleeves.

**September 08** <br> If you haven't already, complete the [Entry Poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiVdav2f6RFCiopp3MGHZRX6PKR5MA77z2NrFrdXV8eFFgaQ/viewform), sign up for the [Discussion Group](https://piazza.com/nyu/fall2016/econub0232), and read the [Syllabus](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_syllabus.pdf) and [Project Guide](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).

**September 22** <br> Submit answers to [Code Practice #1](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_practice_1.pdf).

**September 29** <br> Submit answers to Code Practice 2 (coming soon) <!-- [Code Practice #2](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_practice_2.pdf). -->

**October 13** <br> Submit answers to Code Practice 3 (coming soon) <!-- [Code Practice #3](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_practice_3.pdf). -->

**November 01** <br> Recommended but not graded:  [Optional Code Practice A](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Code/IPython/bootcamp_practice_a.ipynb).

**November 08** <br> Exam (75 minutes, in class, open book, open internet if the wireless is up, bring one page of notes).

**November 17** <br> Submit [Revised Project Ideas](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf). <br> (We're willing to let this slide till November 29.  The point is that you should start thinking about your project as soon as the exam is over.  But if you want to take another week to think about this, do it.)

[Thanksgiving break, have fun]

**November 29** <br> Submit [Project Proposal](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).

**December 06.** Submit [Data Report](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf).  This is really a little late; we urge you to think about data from the beginning. Ask for help if you're not sure you have what you need.

**December 15** <br> Submit project by email to db3@nyu.edu. The subject line should be "bootcamp project ug".  The file name should be your last names separated by dashes and a short title;  eg, something like *Jones-Smith-Zhang-India.ipynb*. See [Project Guide](https://github.com/NYUDataBootcamp/Materials/blob/master/Documents/bootcamp_project.pdf) for additional information.

We're willing to give you another week, but the absolute latest time a project can be submitted is **5pm December 21**.  No exceptions.  Keep in mind that this is the last possible time, not a target; you're more than welcome to submit your project earlier.  And honestly, you don't want this to drag on any longer than this.

 **There is no final exam.** If NYU schedules an exam time, which they sometimes do, we still won't have one.
